```shell
uvx ty check
```

ty will check all Python files in the working directory or project by default.

See the [type checking](./type-checking.md) documentation for more details.

## Installation

To install ty, see the [installation](./installation.md) documentation.

To add the ty language server to your editor, see the [editors](./editors.md) documentation.

## Playground

ty has an [online playground](https://play.ty.dev) you can use to try it out on snippets or small
projects.

!!! tip

    The playground is a great way to share snippets with other people, e.g., when sharing a bug
    report.
