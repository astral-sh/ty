# ty

An extremely fast Python type checker and language server, written in Rust.

> [!WARNING]
> ty is pre-release software and not ready for production use. Expect to encounter bugs, missing
> features, and fatal errors.

ty is in active development, and we're working hard to make it stable
and feature-complete.

## Getting started

### Installation

```shell
uv tool install ty@latest
```

or add ty to your project:

```shell
uv add --dev ty

# With pip.
pip install ty
```

### First steps

After installing ty, you can check that ty is available by running the `ty` command:

```shell
ty
An extremely fast Python type checker.

Usage: ty <COMMAND>

...
```

You should see a help menu listing the available commands.

For detailed information about command-line options, see the [CLI documentation](./docs/cli.md).

### Checking your project

```shell
ty check
```

## Editor integration

ty can be integrated with various editors and IDEs to provide a seamless development experience. This section provides instructions on how to set up ty with your editor and configure it to your liking.

### VS Code

Install the [ty extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astral-sh.ty) from the VS Code Marketplace.

For more documentation on the ty extension, refer to the extension's [README](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty-vscode).

### Other editors

ty can be used with any editor that supports the [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). To start the language server, run `ty server`. Refer to your editor's documentation
to learn how to connect to an LSP server.

## Concepts

### Projects

### Rules -->

### Suppressions

#### Line-level suppression comments

Suppression comments allow you to silence specific instances of ty violations in your code, be they false positives or permissible violations.

> [!NOTE]
> To disable a rule entirely, set [its severity to `ignore`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/ty/main/docs/configuration.md#rules) in your `ty.toml` or `pyproject.toml` or disable it using the [`--ignore` CLI argument](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ty/docs/cli.md#ty-check--ignore).

To suppress a violation inline add a `# ty: ignore[rule]` comment at the end of the line:

```py
a = 10 + "test"  # ty: ignore[unsupported-operator]
```

Multiline violations can be suppressed by adding the comment at the end of the violation's first or last line:

```py
def add_three(a: int, b: int, c: int): ...


add_three(  # ty: ignore[missing-argument]
    3,
    2
)
```

or when adding the suppression to the last line:

```py
add_three(
    3,
    2
)  # ty: ignore[missing-argument]
```

To suppress multiple violations on the same line, list all rule names and separate them with a comma:

```python
add_three("one", 5)  # ty: ignore[missing-argument, invalid-argument-type]
```

The comma separated list of rule names (`[rule1, rule2]`) is optional. We recommend to always suppress specific error codes to avoid accidental suppression of other errors.

ty supports the [`type: ignore` comment format](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/directives.html#type-ignore-comments) introduced with PEP 484. ty handles them similarly to `ty: ignore` comments, but it suppresses all violations on that line, even when using `type: ignore[code]`.

```py
# Ignore all typing errors on the next line
add_three("one", 5)  # type: ignore
```

ty reports unused `ty: ignore` and `type: ignore` comments if the rule [`unused-ignore-comment`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/blob/main/crates/ty/docs/rules.md#unused-ignore-comment) is enabled. `unused-ignore-comment` violations
can only be suppressed using `ty: ignore[unused-ignore-comment]`. They can't be suppressed using `ty: ignore` (without a rule code) or a `type: ignore` comment.

#### `@no_type_check` directive

ty supports the [`@no_type_check`](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/directives.html#no-type-check) decorator to suppress all violations inside a function.

```python
from typing import no_type_check

def add_three(a: int, b: int, c: int):
    a + b + c

@no_type_check
def main():
    add_three(3, 4)
```

Decorating a class with `@no_type_check` isn't supported.

## Configuration

### Configuration files

ty supports persistent configuration files at both the project- and user-level.

Specifically, ty will search for a `pyproject.toml` or `ty.toml` file in the current directory, or in the nearest parent directory.

If a `pyproject.toml` file is found, ty will read configuration from the `[tool.ty]` table. For example, to ignore the `index-out-of-bounds` rule, add the following to a `pyproject.toml`:

**`pyproject.toml`**:

```toml
[tool.ty.rules]
index-out-of-bounds = "ignore"
```

(If there is no `tool.ty` table, the `pyproject.toml` file will be ignored, and ty will continue searching in the directory hierarchy.)

ty will also search for `ty.toml` files, which follow an identical structure, but omit the `[tool.ty]` prefix. For example:

**`ty.toml`**:

```toml
[rules]
index-out-of-bounds = "ignore"
```

> [!NOTE]
> `ty.toml` files take precedence over `pyproject.toml` files, so if both `ty.toml` and `pyproject.toml` files are present in a directory, configuration will be read from `ty.toml`, and the `[tool.ty]` section in the accompanying `pyproject.toml` will be ignored.

ty will also discover user-level configuration at `~/.config/ty/ty.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ty/ty.toml`) on macOS and Linux, or `%APPDATA%\ty\ty.toml` on Windows. User-level configuration must use the `ty.toml` format, rather than the `pyproject.toml` format, as a `pyproject.toml` is intended to define a Python project.

If project- and user-level configuration files are found, the settings will be merged, with project-level configuration taking precedence over the user-level configuration.

For example, if a string, number, or boolean is present in both the project- and user-level configuration tables, the project-level value will be used, and the user-level value will be ignored. If an array is present in both tables, the arrays will be merged, with the project-level settings appearing later in the merged array.

Settings provided via command line take precedence over persistent configuration.

See the [settings reference](./docs/configuration.md) for an enumeration of the available settings.

### Environment variables

ty defines and respects the following environment variables:

#### `TY_LOG`

If set, ty will use this value as the log level for its `--verbose` output. Accepts any filter compatible with the `tracing_subscriber` crate. For example:

- `TY_LOG=uv=debug` is the equivalent of `-vv` to the command line
- `TY_LOG=trace` will enable all trace-level logging.

See the [tracing documentation](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#example-syntax) for more.

#### `TY_MAX_PARALLELISM`

Specifies an upper limit for the number of tasks ty is allowed to run in parallel. For example, how many files should be checked in parallel.

This isnâ€™t the same as a thread limit. ty may spawn additional threads when necessary, e.g. to watch for file system changes or a dedicated UI thread.

#### Externally defined variables

ty also reads the following externally defined environment variables:

##### `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`

Specifies an upper limit for the number of threads ty uses when performing work in parallel. Equivalent to `TY_MAX_PARALLELISM`.

##### `VIRTUAL_ENV`

Used to detect an activated virtual environment.

##### `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`

Path to user-level configuration directory on Unix systems.

### Exit codes

- `0` if no violations with severity `error` or higher were found.
- `1` if any violations with severity `error` were found.
- `2` if ty terminates abnormally due to invalid CLI options.
- `101` if ty terminates abnormally due to an internal error.

ty supports two command line arguments that change how exit codes work:

- `--exit-zero`: ty will exit with `0` even if violations were found.
- `--error-on-warning`: ty will exit with `1` if it finds any violations with severity `warning` or higher.
