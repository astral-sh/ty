# ty

An extremely fast Python type checker and language server, written in Rust.

> [!WARNING]
> ty is pre-release software and not ready for production use. Expect to encounter bugs, missing
> features, and fatal errors.

ty is in active development, and we're working hard to make it stable
and feature-complete.

## Getting started

### Installation

```shell
uv tool install ty
```

or add ty to your project:

```shell
uv add --dev ty

# With pip.
pip install ty
```

### First steps

After installing ty, you can check that ty is available by running the `ty` command:

```shell
ty
An extremely fast Python type checker.

Usage: ty <COMMAND>

...
```

You should see a help menu listing the available commands.

For detailed information about command-line options, see the [CLI documentation](./docs/cli.md).

### Checking your project

```shell
ty check
```

## Editor integration

ty can be integrated with various editors and IDEs to provide a seamless development experience. This section provides instructions on how to set up ty with your editor and configure it to your liking.

### VS Code

Install the [ty extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astral-sh.ty) from the VS Code Marketplace.

For more documentation on the ty extension, refer to the extension's [README](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty-vscode).

### Other editors

ty can be used with any editor that supports the [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). To start the language server, run `ty server`. Refer to your editor's documentation
to learn how to connect to an LSP server.

### Environment variables

ty defines and respects the following environment variables:

#### `TY_LOG`

If set, ty will use this value as the log level for its `--verbose` output. Accepts any filter compatible with the `tracing_subscriber` crate. For example:

- `TY_LOG=uv=debug` is the equivalent of `-vv` to the command line
- `TY_LOG=trace` will enable all trace-level logging.

See the [tracing documentation](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#example-syntax) for more.

#### `TY_MAX_PARALLELISM`

Specifies an upper limit for the number of tasks ty is allowed to run in parallel. For example, how many files should be checked in parallel.

This isnâ€™t the same as a thread limit. ty may spawn additional threads when necessary, e.g. to watch for file system changes or a dedicated UI thread.

#### Externally defined variables

ty also reads the following externally defined environment variables:

##### `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`

Specifies an upper limit for the number of threads ty uses when performing work in parallel. Equivalent to `TY_MAX_PARALLELISM`.

##### `VIRTUAL_ENV`

Used to detect an activated virtual environment.

##### `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`

Path to user-level configuration directory on Unix systems.
